EXPLANATION OF BIG EXPANSIONS:

GUI Mode: The GUI mode will allow users to interact with the spreadsheet in a more
intuitive way. In the gui, the user chooses the number of rows and columns they want in the spreadsheet, and a name for the sheet.
The user can then input data into the cells and manipulate the data as needed, using a toolbar with many options
of saving and editing.

Search Functionality: The search functionality will allow users to search for specific data within the spreadsheet.
The user can input a search term, and the program will highlight the cells that contain the search term.

MOD and SQRT Functions: Two more functions have been added to the spreadsheet: MOD: modulo function,
and SQRT: square root function.
